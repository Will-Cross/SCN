Project Mission & Summary
The Scholarly Communications Notebook (SCN) is an OER index/repository that will serve as the locus of an active, inclusive, empowered community of practice for teaching scholarly communication to emerging librarians. Practitioners, educators, and students will find and contribute open content concerning foundations and recent developments in scholarly communication topics and methods for developing expertise in responding to those developments. The SCN will serve as a central location for soliciting creation of new resources and as a durable and discoverable location for openly licensed scholarly communication teaching and learning content.

Milestones
Develop front page that describes the project (Beginning of March)
We will need to develop a general prototype of the site that outlines what it is, how it is structured, etc.

Develop repository to the point that people can contribute and fork (Beginning of April)
One of the primary purposes of the SCN is to store and share OER materials
This will ultimately include connections with a resources like GitHub for forking. 
Ultimately (but probably not at this stage) connections with a Creative Commons license chooser 
Similarly, we need some way for creators to get credit and measure the impact/quality of their contributions. This might be a simple rating/star system or something more sophisticated like a link with of Altmetric or a similar tool

Feedback from ACRL 2019 Preconference (Mid April)
The SCN prototype will be integrated into a preconference we are hosting at ACRL2019 - one of the major LIS conferences. We will host the workshop on April 10 and solicit feedback on the general design and experience of using the prototype.
